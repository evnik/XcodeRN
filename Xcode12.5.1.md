### Debugging

#### Resolved Issues

*   Improved the performance of the Variables View in very large projects. (75381959, 78035413)

### Signing and Distribution

#### Resolved Issues

*   Resolved an issue in which Xcode failed to `codesign` using a smart card. (78035219)

### Source Control

#### Known Issues

*   When you select Upload Key after you clone a repository from a source control provider and associate a locally-generated key with that repository, Xcode doesn’t upload the key. (78824500)

    **Workaround**: Add the key using the source control provider’s website.

### Swift Packages

#### Resolved Issues

*   Fixed an issue where `swift build` exited silently when building a program with package dependencies and a large compiler crash output. (77558631)

*   Fixed an issue where command-line builds of packages sometimes didn’t print a “Build complete!” message. (77669218)

#### Known Issues

*   Authentication may fail when using Xcode Server with Swift Packages. (77331504)

    **Workaround**: Add `-scmProvider xcode` to the `xcodebuild` arguments in the bot’s configuration.

### Testing

#### Resolved Issues

*   Fixed an issue which caused XCTest UI Recording to not emit automation code in iOS, tvOS, or watchOS. (77511696) (FB9096691)

#### Known Issues

*   UI interruption monitors don’t work in watchOS. (59571331)

*   UI Test Recording fails to generate code for iOS Simulator targets if recording starts after code execution stops at a breakpoint. (77924295)

    **Workaround**: With no breakpoint set, place your cursor within a test method and press the record button.
